# UI Implementation Progress

## Organization Management UI

### Organization Detail View

We've implemented a comprehensive organization detail view with the following components:

1. **OrganizationHeader**
   - Displays organization name with OrganizationChip
   - Shows parent application name in a bordered box
   - Fixed styling issues with OrganizationChip to properly handle undefined values and use correct size props

2. **Tab-based Interface**
   - Overview tab (organization information)
   - Members tab (organization members management)
   - Application Settings tab (formerly "Applications")
   - Billing tab (subscription and payment management)

3. **Application Settings Component**
   - Renamed from "Applications" to better reflect the 1:1 relationship between organizations and applications
   - Displays application information (name, ID, version)
   - Shows resource limits with usage statistics:
     - API calls (daily and monthly limits with usage percentage)
     - Storage usage (with limit and percentage)
     - User count (with limit and percentage)
   - Toggleable features section:
     - File uploads
     - Custom domains
     - Single Sign-On (SSO)
     - API access
     - Advanced analytics
   - Enabled AI models section with toggles
   - Edit mode for administrators to modify settings
   - Save functionality for persisting changes

4. **Billing Component**
   - Displays current subscription plan details
   - Shows payment method information
   - Lists invoices in a table format
   - Presents usage statistics with progress bars
   - Provides dialogs for changing plans and updating payment methods

## UI Improvements

### Dark Mode Compatibility
- Fixed contrast issues in the Features section of Application Settings
- Added proper background colors to Paper components
- Ensured text colors use theme variables for proper light/dark mode support

### Component Structure
- Modularized the organization detail view into separate component files
- Improved prop passing to ensure components can fetch their own data
- Enhanced error handling for undefined values

## Data Model Implementation

The UI now properly reflects the organizational structure where:
- Each organization belongs to exactly one application
- An application can have multiple organizations
- Organizations do not span across multiple applications

This hierarchy is displayed in the UI with the parent application shown in the organization header and the "Application Settings" tab providing management capabilities for the organization's application settings.

## Next Steps

1. **API Integration**
   - Connect UI components to backend APIs
   - Implement data fetching and saving functionality
   - Add proper error handling for API calls

2. **User Permissions**
   - Implement role-based access control for different UI elements
   - Show/hide edit capabilities based on user permissions

3. **Testing**
   - Test UI components across different screen sizes
   - Verify dark/light mode compatibility
   - Test with various data scenarios (empty states, error states, etc.)
