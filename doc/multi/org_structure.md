file handling:
Here are the step as I see it:
1. we finish the authZ schema
2. We create 2 new features in the platform:
--1. proper admin and super admin functionality.
-----a. within these we can manage settings/users, etc.
-----b. we can add functionality to create new "storage", e.g. folders, etc within the common s3 bucket.  While we will normally store everything for a given session's folder, we can also have child folders, etc that can be created by an admin/user/etc 
2. we create a file/upload management platform within the system.  
3. We can integrate our vector db (pinecone) graphdb (neo4j) and supabase for managing the data.
4. we update @multiModalUtils.ts and @storageUtils.ts to work with these new paradigms.

Expected behavior:
Basic in-session image or file upload:
 - upload to default bucket
- get public url
- update auth relationships via ReBac
I'll pause before moving on to more compleex file handling

Primary Hierarchy Structure
appId (App/Platform)
Super-tenant level
Controls global permissions and settings
Example path prefix: /apps/{appId}/
ReBac relation: Would be a "platform" type in your schema
orgId (Organization)
Tenant level within an app
Example path prefix: /apps/{appId}/orgs/{orgId}/
ReBac relation: Your existing "organization" type with parent:platform
userId (User)
Individual identity
ReBac relation: Your "user" type, with membership in organizations
Permissions flow through organization relationships
conversationId (Conversation)
Group of related sessions
Example path prefix: /apps/{appId}/orgs/{orgId}/conversations/{conversationId}/
ReBac relation: Could be a new type with parent:organization
sessionId (Session)
Individual interaction context
Example path prefix: /apps/{appId}/orgs/{orgId}/conversations/{conversationId}/sessions/{sessionId}/
ReBac relation: Could be a type with parent:conversation
Implementing This In Storage
For the storageUtils.ts update, we'd create a function that builds paths following this hierarchy:
}
```typescript
// Conceptual function (not actual implementation)
function getStoragePath(context: {
  appId: string,
  orgId: string,
  userId: string,
  conversationId: string,
  sessionId: string
}, fileName: string): string {
  return `${appId}/${orgId}/conversations/${conversationId}/sessions/${sessionId}/${fileName}`;
}```

For multiModalUtils.ts, instead of embedding base64 data, we'd:
Store the file using the hierarchy path
Generate a URL to that storage location
Return the URL reference instead of the raw data
This hierarchy also maps cleanly to your ReBac schema, allowing for precise access controls based on the natural structure of your application.
