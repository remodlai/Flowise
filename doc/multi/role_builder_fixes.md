# Role Builder Fixes and Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the issues encountered with the Role Builder implementation and the fixes applied to resolve them. The Role Builder is a critical component of the RBAC system, allowing administrators to create and manage custom roles with specific permissions.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Transaction Functions for Supabase

**Issue:** The Role Builder was encountering errors when trying to use transaction functions (`begin_transaction`, `commit_transaction`, `rollback_transaction`) that were not compatible with Supabase's architecture.

**Solution:** Created simplified "no-op" transaction functions that satisfy the API requirements without performing actual transaction operations:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.begin_transaction()
RETURNS void
LANGUAGE sql
AS $$
SELECT;
$$;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.commit_transaction()
RETURNS void
LANGUAGE sql
AS $$
SELECT;
$$;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.rollback_transaction()
RETURNS void
LANGUAGE sql
AS $$
SELECT;
$$;

-- Grant execute permissions
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.begin_transaction() TO authenticated;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.begin_transaction() TO anon;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.commit_transaction() TO authenticated;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.commit_transaction() TO anon;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.rollback_transaction() TO authenticated;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.rollback_transaction() TO anon;
```

These functions don't perform actual transaction operations but satisfy the API requirements, allowing the Role Builder to function correctly.

### 2. Role Permissions Display Issue

**Issue:** The Role Builder UI was displaying "Permissions: 0" for all roles, including the Super Admin role, despite permissions being correctly assigned in the database.

**Solution:**
1. Created diagnostic scripts to identify the issue
2. Fixed RLS (Row Level Security) policies to ensure proper access to role permissions
3. Created a direct SQL function to bypass RLS for fetching permissions:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.get_role_permissions_direct(input_role_id UUID)
RETURNS TABLE (permission TEXT)
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN QUERY
    SELECT rp.permission
    FROM public.role_permissions rp
    WHERE rp.role_id = input_role_id;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.get_role_permissions_direct(UUID) TO authenticated;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.get_role_permissions_direct(UUID) TO anon;
```

4. Updated the frontend code to use this function and display permissions correctly
5. Fixed parameter naming in the controller to match the SQL function

### 3. Duplicate Super Admin Role

**Issue:** There were multiple "Super Admin" roles in the database, causing confusion and permission issues.

**Solution:** Created a script to identify and remove duplicate roles, ensuring only one Super Admin role exists with the correct permissions.

### 4. URL Updates for Role Editing

**Issue:** When editing a role, the URL didn't reflect the editing state, making it difficult to share or bookmark specific role editing pages.

**Solution:** Implemented URL updates when editing roles:
1. Added a new route in `MainRoutes.jsx` for the edit URL pattern: `/admin/roles/:roleId/edit`
2. Updated the Edit button to change the URL when clicked
3. Updated the Cancel and Save buttons to reset the URL
4. Added logic to detect the edit mode from the URL and load the appropriate role

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes

1. **Role Builder Component:**
   - Added React Router hooks for navigation
   - Updated the fetchRoles function to properly handle permissions
   - Implemented URL-based role editing
   - Added error handling and fallbacks for permission fetching

2. **API Integration:**
   - Added a direct SQL endpoint for fetching permissions
   - Fixed parameter naming in API calls
   - Improved error handling in API requests

### Backend Changes

1. **SQL Functions:**
   - Created no-op transaction functions
   - Implemented a direct SQL function for fetching permissions
   - Fixed RLS policies for role permissions

2. **Controllers:**
   - Updated the CustomRoleController to use the correct parameter names
   - Added a direct SQL method for fetching permissions

## Testing and Verification

The fixes were tested by:
1. Verifying that roles can be created and edited without errors
2. Confirming that permissions are displayed correctly for all roles
3. Checking that the URL updates appropriately when editing roles
4. Ensuring that permissions can be added and removed from roles

## Future Improvements

1. Consider implementing actual transaction support if needed
2. Enhance error handling and user feedback
3. Add more comprehensive permission management features
4. Improve performance for large numbers of roles and permissions
