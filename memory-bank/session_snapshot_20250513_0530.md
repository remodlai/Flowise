# Session Snapshot & API Documentation Project Overview

**Project:** Remodl AI Platform - Internal API Documentation for Remodl Core

## 1. Overall Project Goal

To create a comprehensive, accurate, and maintainable OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification for all (~48) internal server API routes of the Remodl Core component (`packages/server/`). This documentation is critical for the integration of Remodl Core with the broader Remodl AI Platform, particularly for the custom UI (`packages/remodl-ui`) and the Zuplo API Gateway.

## 2. Documentation Phases & Status

The API documentation project is structured into several key phases managed by the Shrimp Task Manager:

*   **API_DOC_P1: Foundational Setup & Full Route Inventory (ID: `ef4ee652-...`)**
    *   **Status:** COMPLETE
    *   **Outputs:**
        *   `api_documentation/remodl-core-route-module-inventory.md`: Lists all ~48 route modules and their primary router files.
        *   `api_documentation/remodl-core-internal-api-v1.yaml`: Initial OpenAPI 3.1.0 shell.
        *   Internal map of module base API paths.

*   **API_DOC_P2: Deep Dive Analysis & Detailed Endpoint Mapping (Iterative) (ID: `30108b23-...`)**
    *   **Status:** IN PROGRESS (All constituent batch tasks P2.Batch1 through P2.Batch10 are complete).
    *   **Objective:** For each Remodl Core server route module, perform a deep-dive analysis of every endpoint. This includes reading router, controller, service, entity, and interface files.
    *   **Artifacts Generated per Endpoint:**
        1.  Schema Definitions: YAML files in `api_documentation/schemas/ (shared/ or modules/[moduleName]Schemas.yaml or modules/openai_assistant_api/[Object]Schemas.yaml)`.
        2.  Markdown Analysis: Detailed analysis file in `api_documentation/endpoint_analysis/[moduleName]/[operationId].md`.
        3.  OpenAPI Path Item Fragment: YAML file in `api_documentation/openapi_fragments/[moduleName]/[operationId].yaml`.
    *   **Corrective Actions Undertaken:** A significant portion of this phase involved re-doing documentation for several batches (P2.Batch3, P2.Batch7, parts of P2.Batch9, P2.Batch5.1) due to initial "simulation" errors by the AI. All these have been corrected with full, non-simulated artifact generation.
    *   **Current Sub-Phase:** All per-module documentation tasks (P2.Batch1 through P2.Batch10) are now complete.

*   **P2.Finalize: Create API Documentation Index (ID: `7be1e094-...`)**
    *   **Status:** PAUSED (Was about to generate content for `api_documentation/README.md`).
    *   **Objective (Revised):** Create a comprehensive index Markdown file (`api_documentation/README.md`) that serves as a table of contents for all generated endpoint analyses, providing a summary, general API information, and organized links.

*   **API_DOC_P3: OpenAPI Specification Assembly (ID: `aecfc078-...`)**
    *   **Status:** PENDING
    *   **Objective (Revised):**
        1.  **Schema Audit & Refinement:** Review all schemas from Phase 2 against `VerifyAgainstTypeOrmAndInterfaceDefinitions.mdc` rule.
        2.  **Specification Assembly:** Consolidate all schemas and path fragments into `remodl-core-internal-api-v1.yaml`. Finalize global elements.

*   **API_DOC_P4: Review & Finalize OpenAPI Specification (ID: `1763229c-...`)**
    *   **Status:** PENDING
    *   **Objective:** Holistic review and final corrections of the assembled OpenAPI specification.

## 3. Current Context & Immediate Next Steps (as of this snapshot)

*   **Paused Task:** `P2.Finalize: Create API Documentation Index`.
*   **Reason for Pause:** User (Brian) has requested a discussion on Remodl Core's API key system and authentication mechanisms before proceeding with summarizing security in the `README.md`.
*   **Security Analysis Status:** An initial analysis of security patterns has been performed and documented in `api_documentation/security_analysis.md`. This includes details on general API key validation (`validateAPIKey`), chatflow-specific key validation (`validateChatflowAPIKey`), how API keys and secrets are generated/stored (`utils/apiKey.ts`), and identification of unauthenticated public endpoints.
*   **Immediate Next Step:** Engage in a discussion with Brian regarding the API key system.
*   **Subsequent Steps:**
    1.  Potentially update `api_documentation/security_analysis.md` and the `securitySchemes` in `remodl-core-internal-api-v1.yaml` based on the discussion.
    2.  Resume and complete `P2.Finalize` (create `api_documentation/README.md`).
    3.  Proceed to `API_DOC_P3` (Schema Audit and OpenAPI Assembly).
    4.  Proceed to `API_DOC_P4` (Final Review).

## 4. Key Operational Rules & Challenges

*   **Strict No Simulation:** The `NoSimulationOfRepetitiveTasks.mdc` rule is paramount. All analysis and artifact generation must be explicit and complete for every item.
*   **Schema First, then Fragments:** Per `schema-documentation.mdc` and `VerifyAgainstTypeOrmAndInterfaceDefinitions.mdc`, all DTOs/entities/interfaces involved in an endpoint's request/response must have their OpenAPI schemas defined *before* the endpoint's path fragment (which will `$ref` these schemas) is created.
*   **Memory Bank File Operations:**
    *   The Memory Bank root is confirmed as `/Users/brianbagdasarian/projects/Flowise/memory-bank/`.
    *   `mcp_memory-bank-mcp_get_memory_bank_status` does not reliably list subdirectory contents.
    *   `mcp_memory-bank-mcp_write_memory_bank_file` has shown issues creating *new* files in subdirectories unless the directory is created using `run_terminal_cmd mkdir -p` with the *full absolute path* to the Memory Bank root + relative subdirectory path. The `edit_file` tool with an absolute path is the current reliable workaround for writing new files into Memory Bank subdirectories.
    *   Dedicated tools (`mcp_update_active_context`, `mcp_track_progress`) MUST be prioritized for `active-context.md` and `progress.md` as per `PrioritizeDedicatedMemoryBankTools.mdc`.
*   **Shrimp Task Manager Workflow:** Adherence to `EnforceSequentialShrimpTaskManagerWorkflow` (using `process_thought` after `execute_task` for granular tasks) and `LogThoughtProcessMilestones.mdc` is required. The AI should proceed to implementation for atomic tasks after the `process_thought -> analyze_task -> reflect_task` cycle, rather than always attempting to `split_tasks`.

This snapshot aims to provide a comprehensive overview for resuming work.
