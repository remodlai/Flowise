## Implementation Files
- Router: packages/server/src/routes/apikey/index.ts
- Controller: packages/server/src/controllers/apikey/index.ts
- Service: packages/server/src/services/apikey/index.ts

## Verification Results

### 1. Route and Controller Verification
✅ The route paths and methods match the implementation:
- All 5 endpoints in OpenAPI fragments match the routes defined in apikey/index.ts
- All controller handlers referenced in the routes are correctly documented

### 2. Request Body Verification
✅ The request body schemas match the implementation:
- Create and Update operations require `keyName` as documented
- Import operation requires `jsonFile` as documented
- Schema properties match the controller validation

### 3. Response Verification
✅ The response schemas match the implementation:
- Return types correctly reflect what the services return
- Error responses are properly documented

### 4. Schema Reference Verification
✅ Fixed: Schema references now properly point to schemas defined in ApiKeySchemas.yaml:
- Added missing `ApiKeyWithCount` schema
- Added missing `ApiKeyImportRequest` schema
- All fragments now reference these schemas properly instead of using inline schemas

### 5. Security Verification
✅ Fixed: Security requirements are now properly specified:
- All endpoints now use `ApiKeyAuth` for authentication
- Commented out security requirements were updated and uncommented

## Issues Found and Fixed
1. Missing schema definitions:
   - Added `ApiKeyWithCount` schema which was referenced but not defined
   - Added `ApiKeyImportRequest` schema which was referenced but not defined

2. Inline schema definitions:
   - Replaced inline schema definitions in fragments with proper references to schemas in ApiKeySchemas.yaml

3. Security requirements:
   - Updated and uncommented security requirements in all fragments
   - Changed from `InternalApiKeyAuth` to `ApiKeyAuth` to match actual implementation

## Conclusion
The apikey module documentation, OpenAPI fragments, and schema definitions are now verified and consistent with the actual implementation. All issues have been fixed to ensure proper integration in the root OpenAPI specification.
