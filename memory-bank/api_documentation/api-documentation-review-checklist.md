## Review Process Summary

- **Modules Reviewed**: 16/47 (34.0%)
- **Modules Pending**: 31/47 (66.0%)
- **Modules With Issues**: 0/47 (0%)

## Recurring Issues & Patterns

1. **Schema References**: Some OpenAPI fragments were using local component references rather than file paths
2. **Response Structure**: Documentation sometimes doesn't match actual implementation response format (e.g., missing properties like chatFlows)
3. **Queue Mode**: Production mode (queue-based processing) sometimes not documented
4. **Storage Types**: Multiple storage types (JSON vs DB) sometimes not fully documented
5. **Security Configuration**: Some endpoints used `InternalApiKeyAuth` instead of the correct `ApiKeyAuth` 

## Next Steps

1. Continue reviewing modules based on priority
2. Focus on critical API endpoints next (chatflows, etc.)
3. Establish patterns to apply across similar endpoints
4. Update all OpenAPI fragments to use consistent reference patterns
