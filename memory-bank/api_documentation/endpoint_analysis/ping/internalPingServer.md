# Endpoint Analysis: GET /api/v1/ping

**Module:** `ping`
**Operation ID:** `internalPingServer`
**Description:** A simple health check endpoint. Returns the string "pong" to indicate the server is responsive. This endpoint is used for monitoring and automated health checks to verify that the API server is running and can respond to requests.

**Key Files:**
*   **Router:** `packages/server/src/routes/ping/index.ts` (Route registration)
*   **Controller:** `packages/server/src/controllers/ping/index.ts` (Handler: `getPing`)

**Authentication:**
*   None required - This endpoint is intentionally unauthenticated to allow for health monitoring by services that don't have authentication credentials.

**Request:**
*   **Method:** `GET`
*   **Path:** `/api/v1/ping`
*   **Headers:** None required
*   **Query Parameters:** None
*   **Request Body:** None

**Responses:**

*   **`200 OK` (Success):**
    *   **Description:** Server is responsive and healthy.
    *   **Status Code:** 200
    *   **Content-Type:** `text/plain`
    *   **Body:** The literal string "pong".
    *   **Example Response:** `pong`

*   **`500 Internal Server Error` (Error):**
    *   **Description:** An unexpected server error occurred.
    *   **Content-Type:** `application/json`
    *   **Body:** Standard error response object.

**Core Logic Summary:**
1. The controller's `getPing` handler is extremely simple and just returns the string "pong" with a 200 status code.
2. If any unexpected errors occur, they are passed to the Express error handling middleware via `next(error)`.

**Implementation Notes:**
* This is a minimal health check endpoint with no dependencies on databases or other services.
* The endpoint performs no validations, authorization checks, or data processing.
* Response time for this endpoint should be very fast, making it suitable for frequent health monitoring.
* Most monitoring systems and load balancers expect health endpoints to return a 2xx status code to indicate the service is healthy.
