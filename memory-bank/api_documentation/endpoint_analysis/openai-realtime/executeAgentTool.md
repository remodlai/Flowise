## Implementation Details

The endpoint calls the `executeAgentTool` method of the `openaiRealTimeService`. This method:

1. Validates the chatflow ID, chatId, toolName, and inputArgs
2. Retrieves the chatflow from the database
3. Initializes the agent node with the necessary environment and chat context
4. Finds the specific tool by name from the agent's tools array
5. Executes the tool with the provided input arguments
6. Processes the tool output, including extracting any source documents or artifacts
7. Returns the output, source documents, and artifacts

## Technical Notes

- The request must include a chatId to maintain context across multiple tool executions
- The toolName must match one of the tool names returned by the getAgentTools endpoint
- The inputArgs must follow the schema defined in the tool's parameters
- The response may include sourceDocuments if the tool execution retrieved information from documents
- The response may include artifacts if the tool execution generated any additional data
- Special markers (SOURCE_DOCUMENTS_PREFIX and ARTIFACTS_PREFIX) are used in the tool output to separate the actual output from source documents and artifacts
