*   Controller: `controllers/openai-assistants/index.ts` (Handler: `uploadAssistantFiles`)
*   Service: `services/openai-assistants/index.ts` (Method: `uploadFilesToAssistant`)
*   Middleware: `getMulterStorage().array('files')` from `utils` (for handling file uploads)

**Core Logic Summary:**
1. The request is processed by Multer middleware to handle file uploads.
2. Controller retrieves the credential ID from query parameters.
3. Controller extracts file information (path/key and original name) from the request.
4. Calls service `uploadFilesToAssistant` with credential ID and file information.
5. Service retrieves and decrypts the OpenAI API key from the credential.
6. For each file, reads the file buffer, converts to OpenAI format, and uploads to OpenAI API with 'assistants' purpose.
7. Removes the temporary uploaded files after processing.
8. Returns the array of OpenAI File objects from the uploads.
