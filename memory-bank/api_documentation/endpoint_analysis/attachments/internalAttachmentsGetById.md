# Endpoint Analysis: GET /api/v1/attachments/:id

**Module:** `attachments`
**Operation ID:** `internalAttachmentsGetById`
**Description:** **NON-OPERATIONAL.** This route is defined in `routes/attachments/index.ts` to get a specific attachment by ID. However, the specified controller handler (`attachmentsController.getAttachmentById`) is not implemented or exported from `controllers/attachments/index.ts`. Calling this endpoint will likely result in a server error.

**Key Files:**
*   **Router:** `packages/server/src/routes/attachments/index.ts`
*   **Controller:** `packages/server/src/controllers/attachments/index.ts` (Handler `getAttachmentById` is MISSING)

**Authentication:** (Assumed, if it were operational) Requires API Key.

**Request:**
*   **Method:** `GET`
*   **Path:** `/api/v1/attachments/:id`
*   **Path Parameters:**
    *   `id` (string, required): The ID of the attachment to retrieve.

**Responses (Hypothetical, if operational):**
*   **`200 OK`:** Would return attachment details.
*   **`404 Not Found`:** Attachment not found.
*   **`500 Internal Server Error`:** Due to missing handler.

**Current Status:** Non-functional due to missing controller handler.
