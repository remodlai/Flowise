# Endpoint Analysis: GET /api/v1/attachments/

**Module:** `attachments`
**Operation ID:** `internalAttachmentsGetAll`
**Description:** **NON-OPERATIONAL.** This route is defined in `routes/attachments/index.ts` to get all attachments (presumably for a user or chatflow, though query params are not specified in router). However, the controller handler (`attachmentsController.getAllAttachments`) is missing.

**Key Files:**
*   **Router:** `packages/server/src/routes/attachments/index.ts`
*   **Controller:** `packages/server/src/controllers/attachments/index.ts` (Handler `getAllAttachments` is MISSING)

**Current Status:** Non-functional due to missing controller handler.
