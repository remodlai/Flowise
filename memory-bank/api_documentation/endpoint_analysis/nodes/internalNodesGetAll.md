# Endpoint Analysis: GET /api/v1/nodes/

**Module:** `nodes`
**Operation ID:** `internalNodesGetAll`
**Description:** Retrieves definitions for all available node components (e.g., chat models, LLMs, tools, chains, etc.) loaded in the application. This comprehensive list is used to populate the node library in the UI.

**Key Files:**
*   **Router:** `packages/server/src/routes/nodes/index.ts`
*   **Controller:** `packages/server/src/controllers/nodes/index.ts` (Handler: `getAllNodes`)
*   **Service:** `packages/server/src/services/nodes/index.ts` (Method: `getAllNodes`)
*   **Data Source:** `appServer.nodesPool.componentNodes` (in-memory pool of all loaded node component definitions)
*   **Schema Reference:** `NodeComponentDefinition` (defined in `api_documentation/schemas/modules/NodesSchemas.yaml`, based on `INode` from `flowise-components`)

**Authentication:**
*   Requires API Key.

**Request:**
*   **Method:** `GET`
*   **Path:** `/api/v1/nodes/`
*   **Query Parameters:** None

**Responses:**

*   **`200 OK` (Success):**
    *   **Description:** Successfully retrieved all node component definitions.
    *   **Content (`application/json`)**:
        *   Schema: Array of `NodeComponentDefinition` objects. Each object describes a node component, including its `label`, `name` (internal ID), `version`, `type`, `category`, `icon`, `baseClasses`, and `inputs`/`outputs`/`inputAnchors`/`outputAnchors` parameter definitions.
        *   The response can be quite large, as it contains detailed definitions for all available nodes in the system.
*   **`500 Internal Server Error`:**
    *   **Description:** An unexpected error occurred while accessing node definitions.
    *   **Content (`application/json`):** Error response with message.

**Core Logic Summary:**
1.  Controller (`getAllNodes`) calls `nodesService.getAllNodes()`.
2.  Service (`getAllNodes`) iterates through `appServer.nodesPool.componentNodes`.
3.  For each node component, it creates a deep clone of its definition using Lodash's `cloneDeep` function.
4.  Returns an array of these cloned node definitions.
5.  Controller returns this array as JSON or passes any error to the error handler.

**Implementation Notes:**
* This endpoint performs deep cloning of node definitions to ensure the original definitions aren't modified.
* All nodes are loaded into memory at application startup and stored in the `appServer.nodesPool.componentNodes` object.
* The response from this endpoint can be quite large, as it includes detailed information about every available node type.
* This endpoint is typically called when the flow editor UI initializes, to populate the node library panel.
* Unlike some other endpoints, there's no validation or error checking for missing parameters since this endpoint doesn't take any parameters.
* Errors in this endpoint would typically only occur if there was an issue with the application server or the component nodes pool.
