    summary: Execute Chatflow/Agentflow
    description: >-
      Executes a specific chatflow or agentflow identified by its ID.
      Accepts user input, overrides, history, and optional files.
      Returns a JSON response or streams Server-Sent Events (SSE).
      This is the primary endpoint for interacting with deployed flows.
      Note: Requests are subject to rate limiting via the rate limiter middleware.
