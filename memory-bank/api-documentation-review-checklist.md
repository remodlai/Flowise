## Review Process Summary

- **Modules Reviewed**: 28/47 (59.6%)
- **Modules Pending**: 19/47 (40.4%)
- **Modules With Issues**: 0/47 (0%)

## Recurring Issues & Patterns

1. **Schema References**: Some OpenAPI fragments were using local component references rather than file paths
2. **Response Structure**: Documentation sometimes doesn't match actual implementation response format
3. **Queue Mode**: Production mode (queue-based processing) sometimes not documented
4. **Storage Types**: Multiple storage types (JSON vs DB) sometimes not fully documented
5. **Security Configuration**: Some endpoints used `InternalApiKeyAuth` instead of the correct `ApiKeyAuth` 
6. **Streaming Responses**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) formats were not fully documented - this has been addressed for predictions endpoints
7. **External Dependencies**: Integration with external services (like Langchain Hub) sometimes not fully documented
8. **API Path Discrepancies**: Some modules have route registration that doesn't match directory/file naming (e.g., 'node-config' vs 'node-configs')
9. **Variable Syntax**: Syntax for variables in custom functions was inconsistently documented (e.g., `$variableName` vs. `$[variableName]`)
10. **Module Reuse**: Some endpoints rely on controllers and services from other modules (e.g., node-icons and node-load-methods use the nodes module functionality)
11. **Error Handling Behavior**: Some modules have specific error handling behavior that wasn't fully documented (e.g., returning empty arrays instead of errors)

## Next Steps

1. Continue reviewing modules based on priority
2. Focus on critical API endpoints next (nodes, nvidia-nim, etc.)
3. Establish patterns to apply across similar endpoints
4. Update all OpenAPI fragments to use consistent reference patterns
