## Review Process Summary

- **Modules Reviewed**: 24/47 (51.1%)
- **Modules Pending**: 23/47 (48.9%)
- **Modules With Issues**: 0/47 (0%)

## Recurring Issues & Patterns

1. **Schema References**: Some OpenAPI fragments were using local component references rather than file paths
2. **Response Structure**: Documentation sometimes doesn't match actual implementation response format
3. **Queue Mode**: Production mode (queue-based processing) sometimes not documented
4. **Storage Types**: Multiple storage types (JSON vs DB) sometimes not fully documented
5. **Security Configuration**: Some endpoints used `InternalApiKeyAuth` instead of the correct `ApiKeyAuth` 
6. **Streaming Responses**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) formats were not fully documented - this has been addressed for predictions endpoints
7. **External Dependencies**: Integration with external services (like Langchain Hub) sometimes not fully documented

## Next Steps

1. Continue reviewing modules based on priority
2. Focus on critical API endpoints next (node-configs, node-custom-functions, etc.)
3. Establish patterns to apply across similar endpoints
4. Update all OpenAPI fragments to use consistent reference patterns
