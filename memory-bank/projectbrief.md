We are developing a platform called the Remodel AI Platform, originally based on Flowise AI's open-source software, which has been massively refactored to improve and add functionality and features. 

The goal is to allow for the rapid development in a low-code environment of advanced AI agent workflows and workflow teams that can then be deployed with custom UI as individual SaaS offers. ⁠

The system enables the rapid development of highly advanced AI agents that can work individually or within various agent teams, either in a supervisor-worker scenario or in a linear cyclograph, and they can interact with each other as needed depending on the design schema required for a given solution. ⁠

Our underlying agents themselves have access to very advanced property graph-based memory structures and data access, allowing for virtual self-learning, self-development, and self-improvement, as well as self-documentation, leveraging a significant defensible moat between what is current state-of-the-art and what we are developing. ⁠
