## Prioritize API Key Discussion Over Immediate Next Task
- **Date:** 2025-05-13 11:35:23 AM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** We have completed all P2 Batch tasks for API documentation, including corrective actions. The next scheduled Shrimp Task is 'P2.Finalize: Create API Documentation Index'. However, a full understanding of the API key system is crucial for accurate security scheme definition in the OpenAPI spec and for overall platform security understanding.
- **Decision:** Pause progression to the next Shrimp task ('P2.Finalize') and dedicate the immediate next step to a detailed discussion and analysis of the Remodl Core API key generation, validation, and usage.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Proceed directly to 'P2.Finalize' and address API key details later during the main OpenAPI assembly (API_DOC_P3).
  - Attempt to document API key security schemes based on current understanding without a dedicated discussion.
- **Consequences:** 
  - Delaying 'P2.Finalize' slightly, but ensuring a more accurate and robust OpenAPI specification regarding security.
  - Potentially saves time now but risks rework or inaccuracies in the security definitions later.
  - High risk of inaccurate or incomplete security documentation.

## Architectural Enhancement: Add Ownership to Remodl Core API Keys
- **Date:** 2025-05-13 12:39:08 PM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** To achieve tighter integration, better auditing, and clearer traceability between the Remodl AI Platform (managed by Supabase JWT auth) and the Remodl Core engine, we've decided to enhance the Remodl Core `ApiKey` entity. This involves linking Remodl Core API keys to platform-level entities.
- **Decision:** Plan to add `userId` (platform user), `organizationId` (platform organization), and `applicationId` (platform application) fields to the Remodl Core `ApiKey` entity and its underlying database table. This will be implemented via a database migration and corresponding code updates in the service and controller layers. This enhancement will be scheduled after current high-priority API documentation and finalization tasks are complete.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Keep Remodl Core API keys independent of platform entities.
  - Only add a single generic `owner_identifier` field.
- **Consequences:** 
  - Provides strong, granular linkage for auditing and management.
  - Requires a new database migration and updates to API key creation logic.
  - Improves long-term maintainability and security posture of the integrated platform.

## Remove Incorrect API Documentation for Attachments Module
- **Date:** 2025-05-15 12:55:51 PM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** During the review of the attachments module, we discovered that while the documentation and OpenAPI fragments claimed that GET and DELETE routes existed but were non-operational due to missing controller handlers, these routes weren't actually defined in the router file at all. Only the POST route for uploading files is actually implemented.
- **Decision:** Remove all documentation and OpenAPI fragments for the non-existent GET and DELETE routes, leaving only documentation for the implemented POST route.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Keep documentation but mark as 'planned but not implemented'
  - Create stubs for these endpoints to match documentation
  - Leave documentation as is with 'non-operational' status
- **Consequences:** 
  - Documentation now accurately reflects actual implementation
  - Reduces confusion for developers using the API
  - Preserves only factual information about the codebase
  - Any plans for these endpoints should be documented elsewhere if they are to be implemented in the future

## Standardize Chat-Messages API Paths in Documentation
- **Date:** 2025-05-15 1:01:36 PM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** While reviewing the chat-messages module documentation, I discovered a URL path inconsistency. The actual implementation in the codebase uses '/chat-messages/' (plural with hyphen) for routes, but the OpenAPI documentation was using '/chatmessage/' (singular). Additionally, I found that the code in routes/index.ts actually uses '/chatmessage' to register the router, which does not match the actual route file name of 'chat-messages'.
- **Decision:** Update all OpenAPI fragments and endpoint mapping documents to use '/chat-messages/' (plural with hyphen) to be consistent with the actual route implementation.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Keep documentation as '/chatmessage/' to match routes/index.ts registration
  - Change both documentation and code to use a standardized format
  - Document both path variants as valid
- **Consequences:** 
  - Documentation now matches route implementation in most files
  - Noted potential issue in routes/index.ts that may need code change
  - Improved consistency for API consumers
  - Any clients using the '/chatmessage/' path may need to be updated if the server code is later standardized

## Correct Chat Messages API Paths to Match Actual Route Registration
- **Date:** 2025-05-15 1:05:00 PM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** While reviewing the chat-messages module documentation, we identified a critical discrepancy. The router file is named 'chat-messages/index.ts' (plural with hyphen), but in routes/index.ts the router is registered as '/chatmessage' (singular, no hyphen). This means the actual functional API endpoint is '/api/v1/chatmessage/...' despite the file naming convention suggesting otherwise.
- **Decision:** Revert all OpenAPI fragments and endpoint documentation to use '/chatmessage/' (singular, no hyphen) to match the actual route registration in routes/index.ts, ensuring that documentation reflects the actual functional API endpoints.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Keep documentation as '/chat-messages/' and suggest changing the route registration to match
  - Document both path formats with a note about the inconsistency
  - Create endpoints for both paths via an alias in the router registration
- **Consequences:** 
  - Documentation now correctly reflects the actual functional API endpoints
  - Acknowledges the inconsistency in file naming vs. route registration
  - Ensures API consumers use the correct path for successful requests
  - May highlight a need for future code standardization, but prioritizes accurate documentation over idealistic representation

## Verified Chatflows Module Documentation Accuracy
- **Date:** 2025-05-15 1:09:56 PM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** As part of our API documentation review, we examined the chatflows module following our new verification rule to check registered routes against file naming conventions. We verified the route registration in routes/index.ts (router.use('/chatflows', chatflowsRouter)) and found it matches the file naming convention (routes/chatflows/index.ts). We then compared this with the OpenAPI fragments and endpoint analysis documentation.
- **Decision:** Confirm that the current chatflows module documentation is accurate and no changes are needed. The documentation correctly uses the registered route path ('/chatflows/') and the schema definitions match the entity structure.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Update documentation to add further clarification
  - Add more detailed examples
  - Restructure documentation to match a different format
- **Consequences:** 
  - Documentation remains reliable for API consumers
  - Consistent pattern for route documentation
  - No unnecessary work created
  - Confirms that following our verification rule helps identify both problems (like in chat-messages) and correct implementations (like in chatflows)

## Verified Chatflows-Uploads Module Documentation Accuracy
- **Date:** 2025-05-15 1:17:07 PM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** Following our code implementation verification rule, I performed an in-depth analysis of the chatflows-uploads module. I examined the route registration in routes/index.ts, the controller method implementation, the service method, and most importantly the detailed utility function utilGetUploadsConfig which contains the core business logic that determines upload capabilities. This utility performs sophisticated analysis of the chatflow configuration to detect speech-to-text settings, vector stores supporting file uploads, and nodes that allow image uploads.
- **Decision:** Confirm that the chatflows-uploads module documentation is highly accurate and requires only one minor update: uncomment the security section in the OpenAPI fragment to explicitly indicate that API key authentication is required, matching what's stated in the endpoint analysis.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Leave security section commented out
  - Add more detailed schema definitions
  - Restructure documentation to separate upload detection logic into component sections
- **Consequences:** 
  - Documentation will fully match actual implementation including security requirements
  - API consumers will have clear understanding of authentication requirements
  - The detailed logic analysis in the endpoint documentation provides valuable insight into the complex upload capability detection process
  - The implementation details are thoroughly captured, making this a good reference for how to document complex business logic

## Components-Credentials Endpoint Response Verification
- **Date:** 2025-05-15 1:23:51 PM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** Needed to verify if the components-credentials API response structure matched its OpenAPI documentation to ensure accuracy.
- **Decision:** Confirmed that both the implementation and documentation are correct and consistent. The service returns an array of credential definitions, and the OpenAPI schema properly defines the response as an array of ComponentCredentialDefinition objects.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Update the OpenAPI schema if it incorrectly defined the response structure
  - Modify the service implementation if it didn't match the documented schema
- **Consequences:** 
  - Documentation remains accurate for API consumers
  - No changes needed to either implementation or documentation
  - Increased confidence in the API documentation quality

## Components-Credentials-Icon Documentation Correction
- **Date:** 2025-05-15 1:25:08 PM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** Documentation for the components-credentials-icon endpoint incorrectly states it returns a base64 data URI wrapped in a JSON object with a 'src' property. Examined actual implementation to determine correct behavior.
- **Decision:** The documentation should be updated to reflect that the endpoint returns the actual file content (image/svg+xml, image/png, or image/jpg) directly using res.sendFile(), not a base64 data URI in a JSON object.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Keep current documentation despite inaccuracy
  - Change implementation to match documentation
- **Consequences:** 
  - Documentation will accurately reflect actual API behavior
  - Prevents confusion for API consumers
  - Maintains documentation integrity

## Credentials API Schemas Update

- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** During analysis of the credentials API endpoints and schemas, needed to determine if the documentation matched the actual implementation and make any necessary updates while preserving all implementation details.
- **Decision:** Updated the CredentialsSchemas.yaml and internalCredentialsCreate.yaml files to more accurately reflect the actual implementation. Used $ref to link to schema definitions and aligned field names with the TypeORM entity and interfaces used in the code.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Update controller/service implementation to match existing documentation
  - Leave documentation as-is despite discrepancies
- **Consequences:** 
  - Documentation now accurately reflects the actual API behavior
  - Schema references are properly linked between OpenAPI fragments
  - Field naming is consistent with implemented interfaces

- **Decision:** Updated ExecutionsSchemas.yaml and all related OpenAPI fragments to match implementation, including adding missing schema definitions, correcting parameter types, and adding proper response definitions.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Keep existing documentation despite inaccuracies
  - Create simplified documentation that excludes some parameters
- **Consequences:** 
  - Documentation now accurately reflects API implementation
  - Added proper schema references between fragments
  - Included all supported query parameters
  - Added missing pagination support
  - Fixed parameter types (especially UUID format)

## Update API Documentation Review Progress Statistics
- **Date:** 2025-05-15 2:36:18 PM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** The api-documentation-review-checklist.md file's summary statistics were out of sync with the actual progress tracked in the checklist table. The summary showed only 5/47 modules reviewed while the table indicated 14 modules had been fully reviewed.
- **Decision:** Update the summary statistics in the API documentation review checklist to accurately reflect the current progress: 14/47 modules (29.8%) have been fully reviewed and verified.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Leave the statistics as-is and wait for a formal review checkpoint
  - Recalculate module counts by examining all documentation files directly
- **Consequences:** 
  - Accurate progress tracking ensures better project management
  - Provides clearer visibility into the documentation review project status
  - Helps identify remaining work for prioritization

## Export-Import Module Documentation Verification
- **Date:** 2025-05-15 2:43:52 PM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** The export-import module documentation needed to be verified against the actual implementation to ensure accuracy. The documentation did not match the actual implementation in several ways.
- **Decision:** Update the export-import module documentation to accurately reflect the implementation, add security requirements, and mark it as verified in the checklist.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Leave the documentation as-is and mark it for future comprehensive update
  - Only fix critical issues in the documentation
  - Create entirely new documentation from scratch
- **Consequences:** 
  - Documentation now accurately reflects the implementation
  - Users have correct information about request and response formats
  - Security requirements are properly documented
  - Progress on the review checklist has increased to 31.9%

## Standardize Schema Reference Pattern in OpenAPI Fragments
- **Date:** 2025-05-15 2:46:15 PM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** There was an inconsistency in how schemas were referenced in OpenAPI fragment files. Some used relative file paths (../../schemas/modules/SchemaFile.yaml#/components/schemas/Schema) while others used local references (#/components/schemas/Schema).
- **Decision:** Standardize on using relative file paths for all schema references in OpenAPI fragments and create a Cursor rule to enforce this pattern for future documentation work.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Use local references and combine schemas during documentation generation
  - Use absolute paths with root identifiers
  - Continue using mixed reference patterns
- **Consequences:** 
  - Ensures consistent schema reference across all modules
  - Makes federation of OpenAPI fragments more reliable
  - Centralizes schema definitions in dedicated files
  - Provides clear guidance for future documentation work

- **Decision:** Update the feedback module documentation to accurately reflect the implementation, fix schema references using relative paths, correct field names, add security requirements, and improve response documentation.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Leave incomplete documentation with incorrect references
  - Only fix schema references without validating implementation details
  - Completely rewrite documentation from scratch
- **Consequences:** 
  - Documentation now accurately reflects the implementation
  - Consistent schema referencing patterns across modules
  - Improved response documentation with specific error status codes
  - Progress on the review checklist increased to 34.0%

## Fetch-Links Module Documentation Verification
- **Date:** 2025-05-15 2:52:28 PM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** The fetch-links module documentation needed to be verified and updated to meet our documentation standards. The primary issue was incorrect schema references not using relative paths.
- **Decision:** Update the fetch-links module documentation to use relative schema references, add security requirements, and enhance error descriptions while preserving the accurate parts of the existing documentation.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Complete rewrite of the documentation
  - Minimal fix to only address schema references
  - Leave documentation as-is and wait for the main integration phase
- **Consequences:** 
  - Documentation now follows consistent reference patterns

  - Error responses more clearly documented
  - Progress on the review checklist increased to 36.2%

## Flow-Config Module Documentation Verification
- **Date:** 2025-05-15 2:54:55 PM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** The flow-config module documentation needed to be verified against the actual implementation. The existing documentation didn't accurately describe what the endpoint returns, and schema references were using local references rather than relative file paths.
- **Decision:** Update the flow-config module documentation to accurately reflect the implementation which retrieves available configuration details for all nodes in a chatflow. Fix schema references to use relative paths and add security requirements.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Leave inaccurate description in documentation
  - Completely rewrite the documentation from scratch
  - Only fix schema references without updating description
- **Consequences:** 
  - Documentation now accurately reflects implementation
  - Fixed schema references improve consistency with documentation standards
  - Security requirements are properly documented
  - Progress on the review checklist increased to 38.3%

## Get-Upload-Path Module Documentation Verification
- **Date:** 2025-05-15 3:00:10 PM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** The get-upload-path module documentation needed to be verified against the actual implementation. Schema references were using local references rather than relative file paths, and details about how the storage path was determined were missing.
- **Decision:** Update the get-upload-path module documentation to accurately reflect the implementation that returns the server's storage path. Fix schema references to use relative paths, add security requirements, and include details about the storage path determination logic (based on env vars or default paths).
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Leave schema references as local references
  - Only fix schema references without adding implementation details
  - Create a completely new documentation from scratch
- **Consequences:** 
  - Documentation now accurately reflects implementation
  - Fixed schema references improve consistency with documentation standards

- **Date:** 2025-05-15 3:03:17 PM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** The internal-chat-messages module documentation needed to be verified against the actual implementation. Schema references were using local component references rather than relative file paths, and query parameters were not fully documented.
- **Decision:** Update the internal-chat-messages module documentation to accurately reflect the implementation that returns internal (system) chat messages. Fix schema references to use relative paths, add security requirements, and provide detailed documentation of query parameters and response structure.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Leave schema references as local references
  - Only fix schema references without adding implementation details
  - Keep minimal documentation of query parameters
- **Consequences:** 
  - Documentation now accurately reflects implementation
  - Fixed schema references improve consistency with documentation standards
  - Security requirements are properly documented
  - Enhanced query parameter documentation helps API consumers understand filtering options
  - Progress on the review checklist increased to 42.6%

## Internal-Predictions Module Documentation and Streaming Response Format
- **Date:** 2025-05-15 3:08:52 PM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** The internal-predictions module documentation needed major enhancement, particularly for streaming responses. The existing documentation did not cover the Server-Sent Events (SSE) format or the various event types that can be received from the streaming API.
- **Decision:** Create comprehensive documentation for the internal-predictions module, focusing on properly documenting the streaming response format with all possible event types. This includes creating a new endpoint analysis document for streaming, a new OpenAPI fragment specifically for the streaming endpoint, and enhancing schema definitions with detailed types for all SSE events.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Only document the non-streaming part of the API
  - Add minimal documentation for streaming without detailed event types
  - Add a note about streaming capability without detailed specifications
- **Consequences:** 
  - Complete documentation for both streaming and non-streaming API variants
  - API consumers can properly understand and implement SSE event handling
  - Enhanced schema definitions provide a reference for all possible event types
  - Streaming-specific request requirements clearly documented
  - Progress on the review checklist increased to 44.7%

## Standardized Streaming Event Documentation
- **Date:** 2025-05-15 3:16:24 PM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** The API documentation for streaming endpoints (internal-predictions and predictions) needed significant enhancement to properly document all event types, their formats, and usage patterns. The existing documentation was minimal and lacked detailed examples.
- **Decision:** Created a comprehensive documentation approach for Server-Sent Events (SSE) that categorizes events into logical groups (Flow Control, Node Execution, Content, Tool Usage, Agent, and Metadata), includes detailed examples of each event type, and provides client-side implementation guidance.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Document each event type individually without categorization
  - Only document the most common event types without examples
  - Create a separate common schema document for SSE events
- **Consequences:** 
  - Improved developer experience through comprehensive event documentation
  - Ensured consistency between internal and public prediction endpoints
  - Established a pattern for documenting streaming events that can be applied to other endpoints
  - Provides a clear guide for client implementations consuming the streaming API

## Comprehensive Documentation for Marketplaces Module
- **Date:** 2025-05-15 4:15:49 PM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** The marketplaces module had only one documented endpoint (GET /marketplaces/templates) but the implementation includes three additional endpoints for custom templates. A decision needed to be made about how thoroughly to document these endpoints.
- **Decision:** Created complete documentation for all four endpoints in the marketplaces module, including detailed endpoint analysis markdown files, OpenAPI fragments with proper schema references, and comprehensive descriptions of implementation details. This ensures the API documentation accurately reflects the entire functionality of the marketplaces module.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Document only the existing GET /marketplaces/templates endpoint
  - Create minimal documentation for the additional endpoints
  - Skip this module for now and come back to it later
- **Consequences:** 
  - Improved API documentation coverage, now reflecting the full functionality of the marketplaces module
  - Standardized schema references across all OpenAPI fragments
  - Provided detailed implementation notes that help API consumers understand how the endpoints work
  - Reached 51.1% completion milestone in the API documentation review process

## Accurate Documentation of API Path Discrepancies
- **Date:** 2025-05-15 4:19:30 PM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** During the review of the node-configs module, we discovered a discrepancy between the module name (node-configs) and its actual API route registration (node-config). This mismatch between directory/file naming and actual route registration could lead to confusion for API consumers.
- **Decision:** Always document the actual registered API path in all documentation, even when it differs from the directory or file naming convention. For the node-configs module, we documented the actual path as '/api/v1/node-config/' (singular) rather than '/api/v1/node-configs/' (plural) and added a note explaining this discrepancy.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Use the directory/file name in documentation for consistency with codebase structure
  - Change the actual route registration to match the directory/file name
  - Create redirects to handle both plural and singular forms
- **Consequences:** 
  - Improved accuracy - documentation reflects the actual working API routes
  - Added clarity for API consumers by explicitly noting path discrepancies
  - Identified a recurring pattern that will help improve documentation for other modules
  - Added a new category of issues to track (API Path Discrepancies) in our review checklist

## Consistent Variable Syntax Documentation
- **Date:** 2025-05-15 4:22:04 PM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** During the review of the node-custom-functions module, we found inconsistent documentation of the variable syntax used in custom JavaScript functions. Some parts used `$variableName` while others used `$[variableName]`, although the actual implementation uses the `$[variableName]` syntax.
- **Decision:** Standardize all documentation to consistently use the `$[variableName]` syntax that matches the actual implementation. This includes updating the schema definitions, examples, and descriptions throughout all documentation files to ensure consistency.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Document both syntaxes as alternatives
  - Change the implementation to support both syntax forms
  - Keep the inconsistent documentation as is
- **Consequences:** 
  - Improved clarity for API consumers
  - Consistent examples that will work correctly when copied and used
  - Added a new category of issues to track (Variable Syntax) in our review checklist
  - Identified a pattern to look for in other modules that might use variable interpolation

## Documentation of Module Reuse Patterns
- **Date:** 2025-05-15 4:27:55 PM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** During the review of the node-icons module, we discovered that this module reuses controller and service functionality from the nodes module rather than having its own dedicated implementation. This is a pattern that might occur in other modules as well but wasn't explicitly documented in our review process.
- **Decision:** Explicitly document module reuse patterns in endpoint analysis documentation. When an endpoint is implemented by reusing functionality from another module, this should be clearly noted in the documentation with explanations of how the functionality is shared and what dependencies exist between modules.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Document only the endpoint's direct implementation without mentioning reuse
  - Merge documentation for modules that share functionality
  - Reorganize the documentation structure to group related modules
- **Consequences:** 
  - Improved clarity about the actual implementation architecture
  - Better understanding of dependencies between modules
  - Easier maintenance when shared functionality changes
  - Added a new category of issues to track (Module Reuse) in our review checklist
  - Identified a pattern to look for in other modules

## Documentation of Error Handling Behavior
- **Date:** 2025-05-15 4:31:11 PM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** During the review of the node-load-methods module, we discovered specific error handling behavior where errors from the execution of load methods are caught and transformed into empty arrays rather than propagating as error responses. This behavior wasn't fully documented but is important for API consumers to understand.
- **Decision:** Explicitly document specific error handling behaviors in endpoint analysis documentation. When an endpoint handles errors in non-standard ways (like returning empty arrays instead of error responses, or having special fallback behaviors), these should be clearly documented in the Implementation Notes section of the endpoint analysis.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Document only the standard error responses
  - Recommend changes to standardize error handling across all endpoints
  - Create a separate error handling documentation section
- **Consequences:** 
  - Better understanding of actual endpoint behavior for API consumers
  - Improved expectations for error scenarios
  - Added a new category of issues to track (Error Handling Behavior) in our review checklist
  - Identified a pattern to look for in other modules

## API Path vs Directory Structure Documentation Approach
- **Date:** 2025-05-19 9:03:37 AM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** We have identified a recurring pattern in the Flowise codebase where the actual API endpoint registration (in routes/index.ts) often differs from the directory structure (e.g., public-chatbots module registers as /public-chatbotConfig). This can lead to documentation errors if not properly tracked.
- **Decision:** Document both the directory/module name and the actual registered path in the API documentation, and prioritize the registered path in OpenAPI fragments since that's what API consumers will use.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Only use directory/module names in documentation
  - Rename API paths to match directory structure
  - Create redirects/aliases for mismatched paths
- **Consequences:** 
  - Documentation will more accurately reflect the actual implementation
  - API consumers will have correct paths to use in their integrations
  - We maintain a record of path discrepancies for potential future code standardization

## Three-Phase Plan for Platform Architecture and API Key Integration
- **Date:** 2025-05-19 1:53:32 PM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** Platform Architecture Planning
- **Decision:** Adopt a three-phase plan for Remodl Core database modifications and architectural refactoring: 1. Validate existing migrations on Supabase. 2. Implement API key ownership fields & migration. 3. Refactor core packages (server, ui, components) into private NPMs and establish a new Remodl-Platform repository.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Monolithic approach within existing repo
  - Direct modification without phased testing
- **Consequences:** 
  - Clearer, staged approach to complex changes
  - Reduced risk by validating steps incrementally
  - Sets foundation for robust platform architecture

## UI Decoupling from Core Component Types Confirmed
- **Date:** 2025-05-19 1:53:39 PM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** UI Architecture and Dependency Analysis
- **Decision:** Confirmed that packages/ui primarily consumes API responses rather than having direct TypeScript import dependencies on packages/components for core data structures. This is favorable for decoupling.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - UI directly importing from local components package
  - UI relying on less-typed API data
- **Consequences:** 
  - UI is already designed to consume API data, simplifying transition to a packaged engine
  - Future platform UI can optionally import types from a packaged @remodl/core-components for better type safety

## Strategy for Platform-Contextual File Uploads and Correlation
- **Date:** 2025-05-19 1:53:46 PM
- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** Platform File Management Strategy with S3
- **Decision:** A 'Storage Orchestration Service / File Bridge Service' and a 'PlatformFileRegistry' database table will be necessary to manage platform-contextual file uploads and correlate them with Remodl Core's single-bucket S3 storage and internal file references.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Remodl Core manages multi-bucket logic
  - Platform UI directly uploads to Remodl Core's bucket
- **Consequences:** 
  - Centralizes platform-specific storage logic
  - Keeps Remodl Core's storage model simple (single bucket)
  - Enables platform-level tracking and auditing of files
