## Prioritize API Key Discussion Over Immediate Next Task

- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** We have completed all P2 Batch tasks for API documentation, including corrective actions. The next scheduled Shrimp Task is 'P2.Finalize: Create API Documentation Index'. However, a full understanding of the API key system is crucial for accurate security scheme definition in the OpenAPI spec and for overall platform security understanding.
- **Decision:** Pause progression to the next Shrimp task ('P2.Finalize') and dedicate the immediate next step to a detailed discussion and analysis of the Remodl Core API key generation, validation, and usage.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Proceed directly to 'P2.Finalize' and address API key details later during the main OpenAPI assembly (API_DOC_P3).
  - Attempt to document API key security schemes based on current understanding without a dedicated discussion.
- **Consequences:** 
  - Delaying 'P2.Finalize' slightly, but ensuring a more accurate and robust OpenAPI specification regarding security.
  - Potentially saves time now but risks rework or inaccuracies in the security definitions later.
  - High risk of inaccurate or incomplete security documentation.

## Architectural Enhancement: Add Ownership to Remodl Core API Keys

- **Author:** Unknown User
- **Context:** To achieve tighter integration, better auditing, and clearer traceability between the Remodl AI Platform (managed by Supabase JWT auth) and the Remodl Core engine, we've decided to enhance the Remodl Core `ApiKey` entity. This involves linking Remodl Core API keys to platform-level entities.
- **Decision:** Plan to add `userId` (platform user), `organizationId` (platform organization), and `applicationId` (platform application) fields to the Remodl Core `ApiKey` entity and its underlying database table. This will be implemented via a database migration and corresponding code updates in the service and controller layers. This enhancement will be scheduled after current high-priority API documentation and finalization tasks are complete.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Keep Remodl Core API keys independent of platform entities.
  - Only add a single generic `owner_identifier` field.
- **Consequences:** 
  - Provides strong, granular linkage for auditing and management.
  - Requires a new database migration and updates to API key creation logic.
  - Improves long-term maintainability and security posture of the integrated platform.
