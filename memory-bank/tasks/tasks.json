Implementability:\nThis plan is more intensive per endpoint, involving multiple file reads and the generation of two distinct artifacts. For a batch of 5 modules, it remains implementable *if further broken down into per-module tasks*. The AI must be diligent in extracting all necessary details (request/response schemas, logic summaries, file paths, etc.) for both outputs.

      "analysisResult": "# Reflection on Multi-Phase Plan for Remodl Core Internal API Documentation\n\n## 1. Requirements Alignment & Structural Integrity:\nThe multi-phase plan (Phase 1: Setup/Inventory; Phase 2: Iterative Deep-Dive Analysis & Markdown Documentation per Module; Phase 3: OpenAPI Specification Assembly; Phase 4: Review) comprehensively addresses the objective of creating a detailed OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification for all internal Remodl Core APIs. It ensures all necessary information (routes, methods, handlers, services, entities, interfaces, request/response schemas, auth, logic summaries) is captured methodically.\n\n## 2. Implementability & Scalability:\nThe phased approach, particularly the intention to use `split_tasks` to break down Phase 2 (Deep-Dive Analysis) into per-module (or small batch) tasks, makes this large undertaking implementable and scalable. Each phase has clear inputs and outputs.\n\n## 3. Adherence to `rules.md` and Best Practices:\nThe plan emphasizes adherence to `rules.md` and OpenAPI 3.1.0 best practices, including comprehensive descriptions and the use of reusable schemas. The creation of intermediate detailed Markdown documentation per module (Phase 2 output) will be a valuable asset for accuracy in Phase 3.\n\n## 4.
