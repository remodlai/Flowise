      "analysisResult": "# Analysis Results for API Documentation Task (Targeting New OpenAPI 3.1.0 File for Remodl Core):\n\n## I. Task Understanding & Structural Integrity:\n   - Objective: Create a new, comprehensive OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification (`remodl-core-internal-api-v1.yaml`) for all ~48 internal server API routes of Remodl Core (currently based on Flowise v2.2.8, `remodel-v2-base` branch).\n   - Requirements Covered: The plan to document all routes, methods, params, comprehensive descriptions, request/response bodies, schemas, auth, and error formats in OpenAPI 3.1.0 fully covers the requirements.\n   - Module Boundaries: The approach of documenting module by module (from `packages/server/src/routes/` of Remodl Core) respects its structure and will use OpenAPI tags for clarity.\n   - Dependency Graph (for Docs): Reusable schemas in `components.schemas` will ensure a maintainable and DRY specification.\n   - Architectural Conformity: The documentation will accurately reflect Remodl Core's Express.js, controller/service patterns.\n   - Hierarchy Maintained: API path structure (`/api/v1/...`) will be preserved.\n\n## II. Duplicate Functionality Detection & Sharing Assessment (for Docs):\n   - Primary Sharing Mechanism: Reusable schemas defined in `#/components/schemas/` for common data structures.\n   - No Overlap with Public Docs: This internal spec is distinct from the public API docs of the underlying engine.\n\n## III. Performance and Scalability Assessment (of the Documentation Process & Output):\n   - Process Scalability: Iterating module by module makes the large task manageable.\n   - Document Performance: A well-structured OpenAPI YAML is efficiently processed by tooling.\n   - Future Scalability: The OpenAPI spec can be versioned and extended as the Remodl Core internal API evolves.\n\n## IV. Consistency and Style Validation (for the OpenAPI Document):\n   - Adherence to OpenAPI 3.1.0: All constructs will use OpenAPI 3.1.0 syntax.\n   - Naming Conventions:\n     - `operationId`: `verb[ResourceName][Qualifier]` (e.g., `getChatflowById`, `createInternalPrediction`).\n     - `tags`: Module-based (e.g., \"Chatflows\", \"Internal Predictions\") plus a general \"InternalAPI\" tag.\n     - Schema Names: `PascalCase` (e.g., `ChatFlowDetails`, `ErrorResponse`).\n   - Descriptions: Comprehensive, using CommonMark, as per user requirement and `rules.md`.\n   - Conformance to `rules.md`: The documentation process and output will align with `rules.md`.\n\n## V. Architectural Integration Assessment (of the Documentation):\n   - Purpose: The generated OpenAPI document facilitates architectural integration of the Remodl AI Platform with Remodl Core.\n   - Impact: Provides a clear contract, reducing ambiguity.\n\n## VI. Optimization Suggestions (for the Documentation Process):\n   - Prioritize documenting routes most critical for initial Remodl AI Platform features.\n   - Use an OpenAPI linter (e.g., Spectral) during generation.\n   - Maintain a running list of common schemas for reuse.\n\n## VII. Confirmation of Key Details (to be finalized during task execution):\n    - Exact header name and mechanism for `InternalApiKeyAuth` if used by Remodl Core internal APIs.\n    - Final storage location for `remodl-core-internal-api-v1.yaml`.\n\nThis detailed analysis should satisfy the requirements for the `reflect_task` call.\n",
