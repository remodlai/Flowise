The `default` field's type was described for flexibility.\n    - `INodeData` schema was expanded to include more fields from its base `INodeProperties`, ensured the crucial `id` field is present and required, and `icon` was made non-nullable and required.\n    - `NodeComponentDefinition` schema, which uses `allOf: INodeData`, was updated to also include properties for `credential` (as an `INodeParamSchema` for its definition) and `output` (as an array of `INodeOutputsValueSchema`).\n\nAll changes were made adhering to `VerifyAgainstTypeOrmAndInterfaceDefinitions.mdc`. The three shared schema files are now significantly more accurate.",
