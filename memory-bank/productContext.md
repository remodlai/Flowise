The Remodel AI platform is being developed to allow for the company to rapidly develop and deploy cutting-edge advanced AI agentic solutions, solving real-world problems across industries. Leveraging my significant research and development into concepts like graph-based progressive memory, self-documentation, self-learning, and rapid development deployment for agentic workflows.

The problem that it solves is that it is currently very difficult to create truly self-documenting, self-learning AI agents individually, let alone teams, either working in a supervisor-worker relationship or in a linear cyclone graph relationship. Largely due to limitations of things like context windows and tool calling. Current implementations available individually via Anthropic or OpenAI are limited highly by their context window and don't have the ability to learn over time, let alone actually act as truly virtual agentic employees or members of a given team.

The end result of the agents as they're developed and deployed into individual SaaS offerings is that when deployed, they should largely feel like members of the team. There's additional research and work that we will be implementing around not only maintaining text-based integrations with the various applications developed on the platform, but also implementing things like real-time text-to-speech and speech-to-text, leveraging technologies like Eleven Labs, OpenAI's Whisper, OpenAI's Real-Time API, among others. ⁠
