# Implementation Progress

## Completed
1. Core Architecture:
   - Platform server base (Flowise core)
   - Platform UI foundation
   - Remodl Auth package basic implementation
   - Gateway routing structure

2. Authentication:
   - PKCE flow implementation
   - Basic JWT handling
   - Session management
   - Simple permission checks

## In Progress
1. Gateway Integration:
   - Route handler refactoring
   - Permission system centralization
   - Context management implementation
   - Custom Access Token Hook Update:
     * [x] Identify JWT structure issue with Zuplo
     * [x] Document required changes
     * [x] Retrieve current implementation from Supabase
     * [x] Document current claim structure and placement
     * [x] Verify current hook version number (Current: v9, Next: v10)
     * [ ] Create new version with:
       - [x] Proper userId placement:
          * Keep existing root-level userId ✓
          * Add userId to user_metadata ✓
          * Add userId to app_metadata ✓
       - [ ] All custom claims properly nested under app_metadata
       - [ ] Proper application_ids handling:
          * Add application_ids array to app_metadata
          * Use "global" for platform admins
          * Use specific UUIDs for regular users
          * Maintain single application object for compatibility
       - [ ] Empty arrays/strings for missing application_ids/organization_ids
       - [ ] Simplified error handling (no throws for missing IDs)
       - [ ] Maintain existing claim generation logic
     * [ ] Test new hook with:
       - [x] Standard user login
       - [x] Platform admin login
       - [ ] User with missing application_ids
       - [ ] User with missing organization_ids
       - [ ] Service user login
       - [x] Verify userId appears in all three locations
     * [ ] Update changelog with:
       - [ ] Version number
       - [ ] Changes made
       - [ ] Rationale for changes
       - [ ] Testing results
     * [ ] Final verification:
       - [ ] JWT structure compatibility with Zuplo
       - [ ] All claims properly nested
       - [ ] No breaking changes

2. Auth Package Updates:
   - Method refactoring for gateway
   - Permission handling improvements
   - Escalation flow implementation
   - TokenStorage refactoring to use only localStorage
     * [x] Remove StorageType type definition
     * [x] Fix StorageType references in class
     * [x] Verify authenticatedRequest properly uses StorageItem
     * [x] Simplify storage property to Storage type
     * [x] Remove memory storage code
     * [x] Remove sessionStorage code
     * [x] Update constructor for localStorage only
     * [x] Simplify methods for localStorage only
     * [x] Remove sessionStorage and memory tests
     * [x] Update localStorage tests
     * [x] Update error handling tests
     * [x] Remove StorageType from RemodlAuth
     * [x] Update RemodlAuth constructor
     * [x] Update related documentation
