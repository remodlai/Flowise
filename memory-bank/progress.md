- [2025-05-19 1:51:02 PM] [Unknown User] - Formulated Multi-Phase Plan for Platform Architecture & API Key Integration: Defined a three-phase strategic plan: 1. Validate existing Remodl Core migrations on Supabase. 2. Implement and test API key ownership schema changes (add user/org/app IDs to ApiKey entity). 3. Refactor core components (server, ui, components) into private NPM packages and establish new Remodl-Platform repository structure. This plan will guide the next major development effort.
- [2025-05-19 1:50:55 PM] [Unknown User] - Completed Full API Documentation Review: All non-excluded Remodl Core API modules (42 out of 47) have been reviewed. Documentation artifacts (endpoint analysis, OpenAPI fragments, schemas) are complete. The API is now fully documented at a per-endpoint level, ready for consolidation into a root OpenAPI specification.
- [2025-05-19 12:25:58 PM] [Unknown User] - Completed review of versions module and all pending modules: Reviewed and updated the versions module documentation.

- [2025-05-15 10:43:47 PM] [Unknown User] - Revised Analysis of openai-assistants Module: Revised analysis of openai-assistants module. The key issue is a router configuration error: the route for getting a single assistant is incorrectly defined as ['/', '/:id'] instead of just '/:id', creating a conflict with the root path. The documentation correctly describes the intended behavior. We also need to document the file-related endpoints in the openai-assistants-files module.
- [2025-05-15 10:42:55 PM] [Unknown User] - Analysis of openai-assistants Module: Completed analysis of openai-assistants module documentation and implementation.

- [2025-05-15 10:31:56 PM] [Unknown User] - Task Execution Plan Articulated: Detailed plan for P3B.Fix.12 (Fix get-upload-path Method Discrepancy) formulated via process_thought. After thorough investigation, found that both the Markdown documentation and OpenAPI fragment already correctly describe GET method, not POST as suggested in the task description. The documentation is already aligned with the actual implementation, so no changes are needed.
- [2025-05-15 10:29:43 PM] [Unknown User] - Task Execution Plan Articulated: Detailed plan for P3B.Fix.11 (Fix get-upload-file Parameter Type Mismatch) formulated via process_thought. After thorough investigation, found that both the Markdown documentation and OpenAPI fragment already correctly describe query parameters, not path parameters as suggested in the task description. The documentation is already aligned with the actual implementation, so no changes are needed.
- [2025-05-14 4:24:07 PM] [Unknown User] - FlowConfigSchemas.yaml File Created: Created the FlowConfigSchemas.yaml file in memory-bank/api_documentation/schemas/modules/ with comprehensive schema definitions. Defined four schemas: UploadFileSizeAndTypes, UploadConfig, OverrideConfig, and FlowConfigResponse. After reviewing the documentation, updated the FlowConfigResponse schema to match the actual response structure with chatbotConfig, speechToText, uploadsConfig, and availableConfigs properties.
- [2025-05-14 4:22:44 PM] [Unknown User] - Task Execution Plan Articulated: Detailed plan for P3B.Fix.10 (Create FlowConfigSchemas.yaml file) formulated via process_thought.

Found that existing Markdown documentation and OpenAPI fragment are already correct but reference schemas that don't exist yet.
- [2025-05-14 4:19:13 PM] [Unknown User] - FetchLinksSchemas.yaml Created: Created the FetchLinksSchemas.yaml file in memory-bank/api_documentation/schemas/modules/ with comprehensive schema definitions for the fetch-links module. Defined two schemas: FetchLinksQueryParams (documenting the required query parameters) and FetchLinksResponse (matching the actual response structure with status and links array). Verified that both the Markdown documentation and OpenAPI fragment already correctly describe the GET endpoint with query parameters, contrary to the task description that suggested they showed a POST endpoint.
- [2025-05-14 4:18:20 PM] [Unknown User] - Fetch-links Module Documentation Analysis Completed: Examined the fetch-links module implementation, documentation, and OpenAPI fragment. Found that contrary to the task description, both the Markdown documentation and OpenAPI fragment already correctly describe a GET endpoint with query parameters. The only issue is the missing FetchLinksSchemas.yaml file that should define the response schema referenced in the OpenAPI fragment.
- [2025-05-14 4:15:46 PM] [Unknown User] - Node-configs Documentation Analysis Completed: After thorough analysis of the node-configs module, I found that the documentation, schema, and implementation are already correctly aligned. The Markdown documentation and OpenAPI fragment both correctly describe a POST endpoint that accepts an array of node names in the request body, and the NodeConfigsSchemas.yaml file already exists with proper schema definitions. No changes are needed as the previously identified discrepancy has already been fixed.
- [2025-05-14 4:13:02 PM] [Unknown User] - Marketplaces Module Documentation Updated: Fixed the path discrepancy in the marketplaces module documentation by renaming the Markdown file to match the operation ID (from internalMarketplacesGetAll.md to internalMarketplacesGetAllTemplates.md) and deleting the incorrect OpenAPI fragment that referenced a non-existent root path. Verified that the correct OpenAPI fragment properly references the GetAllMarketplaceTemplatesResponse schema from MarketplacesSchemas.yaml. All documentation now consistently references the correct path /marketplaces/templates.
- [2025-05-14 4:11:55 PM] [Unknown User] - Marketplaces Module Documentation Analysis Completed: Completed analysis of the marketplaces module documentation discrepancy. Found that the Markdown file is named 'internalMarketplacesGetAll.md' while it correctly references the path '/api/v1/marketplaces/templates' and operation ID 'internalMarketplacesGetAllTemplates'.

- [2025-05-14 4:09:01 PM] [Unknown User] - Feedback Module Documentation Analysis Completed: Completed analysis of the feedback module documentation inconsistency. Found that the Markdown documentation file is named 'internalFeedbackCreate.md' while the OpenAPI fragment correctly uses 'internalFeedbackCreateOrUpdate.yaml'. The documentation within the Markdown file already correctly identifies the operation ID as 'internalFeedbackCreateOrUpdate'. Planning to rename the Markdown file to match the OpenAPI fragment name to ensure consistency.
- [2025-05-14 4:05:02 PM] [Unknown User] - Created export-importSchemas.yaml File: Created the missing export-importSchemas.yaml file for the export-import module based on a thorough analysis of the actual implementation.

- [2025-05-14 11:36:22 AM] [Unknown User] - Comprehensive Status Update: We've completed the OpenAPI schema auditing phase (P3A.Batch1-P3A.Batch8) where we've verified all schema files against their corresponding TypeScript interface definitions. Now, before proceeding to create the root OpenAPI specification, we've created a new set of tasks (P3B.0.1-P3B.0.11) for a comprehensive pre-integration verification. 

This verification will systematically review all 50+ modules in manageable batches, checking: 
1) Markdown documentation against actual implementations
2) OpenAPI fragments against implementations
3) Schema references for correct format and existence
4) Consistency between documentation and fragments
5) Cross-module consistency in reference patterns

This thorough verification step is critical to ensure the final assembled OpenAPI specification will be accurate, consistent, and properly integrated. Only after completing this verification will we proceed to P3B.1 (Initialize Root OpenAPI Spec File).
