- Terminology update: "Flowise" (as the engine) is now referred to as "Remodl Core".
- Prioritized full documentation of **Remodl Core** server routes before making UI architectural changes.
- Decision made to "start fresh" on `remodel-v2-base` (based on upstream Flowise v2.2.8) for **Remodl Core**.
- The Remodl AI Platform features multi-application, multi-tenant architecture (Supabase for business logic, Zuplo for API gateway).
- Custom UI for Remodl AI Platform will likely be in a duplicated, dedicated UI package.
- The `Flowise` directory contains the **Remodl Core** codebase (forked initially from FlowiseAI). `Flowise-Upstream` is a reference clone.
- Memory Bank path: `/Users/brianbagdasarian/projects/Flowise/memory-bank`.
- Documented the monorepo build & serve pattern (for **Remodl Core**) in `system-patterns.md`.
- Confirmed `packages/api-documentation` relates to the public API of the underlying engine.
