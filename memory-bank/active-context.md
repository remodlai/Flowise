# Current Context

## Corrective Documentation Tasks (Highest Priority) - ALL COMPLETE
- **Objective:** Fully and correctly document all previously simulated Remodl Core server API endpoints. No shortcuts. This includes defining schemas for all DTOs/Interfaces used in request/response bodies and referencing them in OpenAPI fragments.
- **Method:** For each operation, perform a deep-dive analysis (router, controller, service, entities, interfaces) and generate complete Markdown analysis, OpenAPI fragment files, and necessary schema definitions. Store in Memory Bank.
- **Tracking:** Use `progress.md` to log start/completion of each item.

## Ongoing Tasks

- Continue with verification task P3B.0.1 for Batch 1 modules
- Examine missing OpenAI schemas (OpenAIThread, OpenAIMessage, OpenAIRun, OpenAIRunStep, etc.) when reviewing OpenAI assistant documentation
## Known Issues

- openAiAssistantSchemas.yaml appears to be missing several schema definitions that were planned (OpenAIThread, OpenAIMessage, OpenAIRun, OpenAIRunStep)
## Next Steps

- [11:36:22 AM] [Unknown User] Comprehensive Status Update: We've completed the OpenAPI schema auditing phase (P3A.Batch1-P3A.Batch8) where we've verified all schema files against their corresponding TypeScript interface definitions. Now, before proceeding to create the root OpenAPI specification, we've created a new set of tasks (P3B.0.1-P3B.0.11) for a comprehensive pre-integration verification. 

This verification will systematically review all 50+ modules in manageable batches, checking: 
1) Markdown documentation against actual implementations
2) OpenAPI fragments against implementations
3) Schema references for correct format and existence
4) Consistency between documentation and fragments
5) Cross-module consistency in reference patterns

This thorough verification step is critical to ensure the final assembled OpenAPI specification will be accurate, consistent, and properly integrated. Only after completing this verification will we proceed to P3B.1 (Initialize Root OpenAPI Spec File).
- [11:32:44 AM] [Unknown User] Created Verification Tasks for Pre-Integration Check: Created 11 subtasks for the P3B.0 Pre-Integration Verification of OpenAPI Documentation task: 10 batch-specific verification tasks (each handling ~5 modules) plus a final cross-module integration check.

- [11:29:01 AM] [Unknown User] Task Execution Plan Articulated: Detailed plan formulated for P3B.0 (Pre-Integration Verification) via process_thought.

- Terminology update: "Flowise" (as the engine) is now referred to as "Remodl Core".
- Prioritized full documentation of **Remodl Core** server routes before making UI architectural changes.
- Decision made to "start fresh" on `remodel-v2-base` (based on upstream Flowise v2.2.8) for **Remodl Core**.
- The Remodl AI Platform features multi-application, multi-tenant architecture (Supabase for business logic, Zuplo for API gateway).
- Custom UI for Remodl AI Platform will likely be in a duplicated, dedicated UI package.
- The `Flowise` directory contains the **Remodl Core** codebase (forked initially from FlowiseAI). `Flowise-Upstream` is a reference clone.
- Memory Bank path: `/Users/brianbagdasarian/projects/Flowise/memory-bank`.
- Documented the monorepo build & serve pattern (for **Remodl Core**) in `system-patterns.md`.
- Confirmed `packages/api-documentation` relates to the public API of the underlying engine.
