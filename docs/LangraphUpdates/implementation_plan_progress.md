## In Progress

### 1. Sequential Agents Integration
- ðŸ”„ Replacing usage of ISeqAgentsState with StateType from @langchain/langgraph
- ðŸ”„ Updating agent nodes to use new state management
- ðŸ”„ Integrating with LangGraph's native functionality

## Next Steps

### 1. LangGraph Native Features Integration
- [ ] Implement Graph.get_state()
- [ ] Implement Graph.get_messages()
- [ ] Implement Graph.stream()
- [ ] Review and replace existing Flowise functionality with LangGraph equivalents

### 2. Agent Node Updates
- [ ] Update all sequential agent nodes to use new state system
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and recovery
- [ ] Add support for new LangGraph features
- [ ] Update node configuration UI

### 3. Testing and Documentation
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for new implementations
- [ ] Update documentation with new features
- [ ] Create migration guide for existing implementations
- [ ] Add examples for common use cases

### 4. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize checkpoint storage and retrieval
- [ ] Improve message handling efficiency
- [ ] Add caching where appropriate
- [ ] Benchmark and optimize critical paths

## Open Questions
1. How to handle migration of existing flows? ANSWER: We can ignore them. This will be treated as net new.
2. What's the best approach for backward compatibility? We don't have to concern ourselves with this.
3. How to handle custom channel values in the UI?
4. Best practices for error recovery in distributed environments?

## Notes
- Keep focus on maintaining clean, performant code
- Ensure backward compatibility where possible
- Document all breaking changes
- Consider UI/UX implications of new features

## Future Enhancements: Memory Store System

### Overview
LangGraph's native store implementations can be extended into Flowise nodes, providing powerful memory management capabilities while maintaining compatibility with LangGraph's core functionality.

### Planned Store Node Types

1. **Basic InMemoryStore Node**
   - Native LangGraph InMemoryStore implementation
   - Full support for standard operations (put, get, search, delete)
   - Vector search capabilities
   - Connection to State/Start nodes
   - Namespace management through UI

2. **Persistent Store Nodes** (BaseStore implementations)
   - PostgreSQL Store Node
     - Persistent storage with PostgreSQL backend
     - Transaction support
     - Efficient indexing
   
   - Vector Database Store Node
     - Integration with vector databases (Pinecone, Upstash)
     - Optimized for similarity search
     - Scalable vector operations
   
   - Neo4j Store Node
     - Graph database backend
     - Combined graph and vector capabilities
     - Complex relationship queries
     - Native vector search support

3. **MemoryManager Node**
   - Accepts multiple Store node inputs
   - Unified query interface
   - Namespace management across stores
   - Intelligent query routing
   - Cross-store search capabilities

### Integration Points
- Direct connection to State node
- Integration with Start node
- Compatibility with sequential agent flows
- Support for cross-thread persistence
- UI components for store configuration and monitoring

### Key Features to Maintain
- Full compatibility with LangGraph's native methods
- Type safety across implementations
- Consistent error handling
- Performance optimization
- Clear documentation and examples

This enhancement will provide powerful memory management capabilities while maintaining the simplicity and flexibility of the Flowise platform.
