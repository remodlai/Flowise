# Readme for Application-related routes and controllers and services



Applications are the highest functional level of the Remodel AI platform. They allow for the rapid development of separate SaaS-based solutions to be created, leveraging the platform's abilities, and contain the associated organizations and organization users, as well as their flows, document stores, assets, files, etc.

The application routes are designed to be semantic in nature, easily understood, and specific in their use case. We tend to avoid using query params when possible and instead try to use path params as much as possible to maintain clarity both in the structure of the URLs and in the ability to be specific when accessing various resources related to applications. ‚Å†
