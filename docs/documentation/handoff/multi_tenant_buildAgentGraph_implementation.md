# Multi-Tenant Support Implementation for buildAgentGraph.ts

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for adding multi-tenant support to the `buildAgentGraph.ts` file, similar to what has been done in `buildChatflow.ts`. The changes will ensure proper handling of application IDs, organization IDs, and user IDs throughout the agent graph execution process.

## Implementation Checklist

1. **Update the options object in buildAgentGraph.ts** ✅
   - Add appId, orgId, and userId from flowConfig to the options object ✅
   - Ensure these values are passed to node initialization functions ✅

2. **Add logging for multi-tenant context** ✅
   - Add detailed logging for appId, orgId, and userId ✅
   - Log the multi-tenant context at key points in the execution flow ✅

3. **Fix circular reference issues** ✅
   - Avoid JSON.stringify on objects with circular references (appDataSource, logger) ✅
   - Replace console.log statements with safer logger.debug calls ✅
   - Implement selective logging for complex objects ✅

4. **Update agent graph compilation functions** ✅
   - Update compileMultiAgentsGraph to pass appId, orgId, and userId ✅
   - Update compileSeqAgentsGraph to pass appId, orgId, and userId ✅
   - Ensure consistent application context throughout the graph execution ✅

5. **Add proper error handling for multi-tenant scenarios** ✅
   - Add specific error handling for multi-tenant related issues ✅
   - Ensure errors include relevant context information ✅

6. **Test multi-tenant functionality**
   - Test with different application IDs
   - Test with different organization IDs
   - Test with different user IDs
   - Verify credential retrieval works correctly
