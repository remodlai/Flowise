# JWT Token Validation Fix

## Overview

This document explains the fix implemented on March 14, 2025, to address the critical issue where JWT tokens were being incorrectly used as API key IDs in the credential retrieval process.

## Problem Description

After migrating to Supabase for authentication and credential storage, we encountered an issue where the system was attempting to use JWT tokens as key IDs when retrieving secrets from Supabase. This resulted in "Secret not found" errors because the system was looking for a secret with a key ID that matched the entire JWT token, which doesn't exist.

The root cause was in the authentication middleware, specifically in the `validateAPIKey` and `validateChatflowAPIKey` functions in `packages/server/src/utils/validateKey.ts`. These functions were extracting the token from the Authorization header and passing it directly to the `apikeyService.verifyApiKey` function, which then tried to use it as a key ID to look up a secret in Supabase.

## Solution Implemented

We modified the authentication middleware to distinguish between JWT tokens and API keys based on their format:

1. Added a helper function `isLikelyJWT` that checks if a token has the typical JWT format (three parts separated by dots).

2. Updated the `validateAPIKey` and `validateChatflowAPIKey` functions to check if the token from the Authorization header is likely a JWT token.

3. If the token is identified as a JWT, the system now skips the API key validation process since JWT tokens are already validated by the Supabase Auth middleware.

4. If the token is not a JWT, it continues with the existing API key validation process.

5. Added logging to help diagnose any future issues with token validation.

## Code Changes

### 1. Added a helper function to detect JWT tokens

```typescript
/**
 * Check if a token is likely a JWT token
 * @param {string} token
 * @returns {boolean}
 */
const isLikelyJWT = (token: string): boolean => {
    // JWT tokens have three parts separated by dots
    return token.split('.').length === 3
}
```

### 2. Updated the validateAPIKey function

```typescript
export const validateAPIKey = async (req: Request) => {
    const authorizationHeader = (req.headers['Authorization'] as string) ?? (req.headers['authorization'] as string) ?? ''
    if (!authorizationHeader) return false

    const suppliedKey = authorizationHeader.split(`Bearer `).pop()
    if (suppliedKey) {
        // Check if this looks like a JWT token
        if (isLikelyJWT(suppliedKey)) {
            // This is likely a JWT token, not an API key
            // JWT validation is handled by Supabase Auth middleware
            logger.debug('Authorization header contains a JWT token, skipping API key validation')
            return true
        } else {
            // This is likely an API key, validate it
            try {
                await apikeyService.verifyApiKey(suppliedKey, req)
                return true
            } catch (error) {
                logger.error(`API key validation failed: ${error}`)
                return false
            }
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

### 3. Updated the validateChatflowAPIKey function

```typescript
export const validateChatflowAPIKey = async (req: Request, chatflow: ChatFlow) => {
    const chatFlowApiKeyId = chatflow?.apikeyid
    if (!chatFlowApiKeyId) return true

    const authorizationHeader = (req.headers['Authorization'] as string) ?? (req.headers['authorization'] as string) ?? ''
    if (chatFlowApiKeyId && !authorizationHeader) return false

    const suppliedKey = authorizationHeader.split(`Bearer `).pop()
    if (suppliedKey) {
        // Check if this looks like a JWT token
        if (isLikelyJWT(suppliedKey)) {
            // This is likely a JWT token, not an API key
            // JWT validation is handled by Supabase Auth middleware
            logger.debug('Authorization header contains a JWT token, skipping API key validation')
            return true
        } else {
            // This is likely an API key, validate it
            try {
                await apikeyService.verifyApiKey(suppliedKey, req)
                return true
            } catch (error) {
                logger.error(`API key validation failed: ${error}`)
                return false
            }
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Prevents Credential Retrieval Errors**: The system no longer attempts to use JWT tokens as API key IDs, preventing "Secret not found" errors.

2. **Maintains Security**: JWT tokens are still validated by the Supabase Auth middleware, ensuring proper authentication.

3. **Improves Logging**: Added logging helps diagnose any future issues with token validation.

4. **Simplifies Authentication Flow**: The system now correctly distinguishes between different types of authentication tokens.

## Future Improvements

While this fix addresses the immediate issue, there are still some improvements that could be made:

1. **Standardize Application ID Handling**: Create a unified function to extract application ID from various sources (body, query, headers).

2. **Update RLS Policies**: Modify policies to check for both built-in roles and dynamic roles, ensuring they match our JWT claims structure.

3. **Implement Proper Token Refresh**: Add token refresh logic that works with both user authentication and API keys.

4. **Enhance Error Handling**: Improve error messages and logging for authentication failures.

## Testing

To test this fix:

1. Log in to the platform using a valid user account to get a JWT token.
2. Use this JWT token in the Authorization header when making API requests.
3. Verify that credential retrieval works correctly.
4. Check the logs to ensure the system correctly identifies the token as a JWT.

## Conclusion

This fix addresses a critical issue in our authentication flow by correctly distinguishing between JWT tokens and API keys. It prevents the system from trying to use JWT tokens as API key IDs, which was causing credential retrieval errors. This is an important step in our migration to Supabase for authentication and credential storage.
