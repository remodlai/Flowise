When implementing a planned or discussed implementation that is beyond a single file, or has multiple steps, you must first create an implementation checklist, and update it at the completion of each step.  This normally would be in the /docs/documentation/handoff directory, in the appropriate location.

You must execute to the checklist. 
If you need to deviate, based on further conversation, update the checklist, and then proceed.
At the completion of each line item, update a "changelog" for the specific checklist with what was completed.
