ALL SQL FILES NOT IN packages/server/src/migrations/multi-tenant should not be touched.  
Do not trust any sql file in packages/server/src/migrations/multi-tenant as being up to date, unless it has "valid" in the name.
Never name anything including "valid" unless I have confirmed it worked. Then you can update the name.  If it no longer works, rename it to "invalid"
