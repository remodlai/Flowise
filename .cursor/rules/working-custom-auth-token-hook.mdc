The following is our current, working auth token hook: [working_auth_token_hook_valid.sql](mdc:packages/server/src/migrations/multi-tenant/custom_access_hooks/working_hook_valid/working_auth_token_hook_valid.sql)

DO NOT ALTER THIS.  THIS IS A FALL BACK FOR US, AND SHOULD BE REFERENCED WHEN MAKING SUGGESTED EDITS, policy updates, etc in Supabase, or any time auth is required.
