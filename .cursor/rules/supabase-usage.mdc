Our admin layer is being built using Supabase, including Supabase Auth, Supabase Database, and Supabase Storage.
This is separate from our underlying core databases.
We use supabase auth with RBAC and custom claims.

To access our supabase postgres database you can use: 
PGPASSWORD=Bagsisgod321! psql -h db.voksjtjrshonjadwjozt.supabase.co -p 5432 -d postgres -U postgres     


You must always check existing schema, definitions, policies, functions, etc prior to suggesting edits, or generating .sql
